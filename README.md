# Functions, Methods, and Objects
## WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 
## Declaring a function
### To creat a function, you give it a name and then write the statements neesed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.

## Calling a function
### Having declared the function, you can then execute all of the satements between its curly braces with just one line of code.

## Declaring functions that need information
### Sometimes a function needs specific information to perform its task. In such cases, when you declare the function you give it *parameters*. Inside the function, the parameters act like variables
